# TL;DR — Hiring Manager Brief

**One-line summary:** Revenue growth is flat and concentrated: a very small share of customers and SKUs drive most of the business. Prioritize targeted retention of high-value customers, convert anonymous high‑AOV buyers, and fix data quality to enable measurable campaigns.

---

## Key metrics (Year‑2 snapshot)
- **YoY total revenue:** **+1%**  
- **Identified-customer revenue:** **−2.7%** YoY
- **Customer net change:** **+1%** headcount (4264 → 4320); **lost 1,526** customers vs **1,582** new
- **Revenue concentration:** top **2%** customers ≈ **36%** of revenue; top **20%** > **73%**
- **Anonymous transactions:** **24.5%** of transactions; anonymous AOV **£1,032.50** (higher than Elite AOV £931.20)
- **SKU concentration:** top **5%** SKUs ≈ **45.5%** of revenue

## Top 3 recommended priorities (what to start with this quarter)
1. **Retention for top cohorts (Immediate):**  Run targeted, measurable retention campaigns for VIP/Elite/Premium — small tests with holdouts and LTV tracking.  
2. **Identify anonymous buyers (Near term):** Add low-friction identity capture (email/receipt incentives) and measurement hooks to convert high-AOV anonymous buyers into marketing contacts.  
3. **Data & pipeline fixes (Foundational):** Add discount flag, canonical product/customer masters, standardized cancellation linkage, and ETL deduplication/ID-normalization to enable reliable targeting and measurement.

---

## Quick business impact (why these priorities)
- Protecting the top **2–20%** of customers preserves the majority of revenue and delivers the highest ROI for retention spend.  
- Capturing anonymous high-AOV buyers unlocks immediate revenue growth via targeted offers (high conversion potential).  
- Data fixes reduce wasted marketing spend and make campaign measurement possible — without them, personalization and lift testing are unreliable.

## Where to find details
- Full analysis, charts, and methodology: **README.md** (Insight Deep Dive).  
- Detailed campaign playbook and KPI table: **Recommendation.md**.  
- Repro notebooks and code: `/notebooks` (see `requirements.txt`).

---

**Decision request for leadership:** Approve budget and resource allocation for one pilot retention campaign (target: top 5% customers) and one identity-capture initiative (email/receipt incentive). Expect to measure incremental monthly LTV and conversion uplift within 8–12 weeks of launch.
