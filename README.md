# Data-Analyst-Project
Exploratory data analysis for an online store based in UK.

---

## TL;DR

Quick summary: Revenue growth is flat and the business is highly dependent on a very small set of customers and products. Targeted retention and identification of anonymous buyers are the highest-impact levers.

Key metrics:
- YoY revenue: +1% total; identified-customers revenue: −2.7% YoY.
- Customer headcount: +1% (4264 → 4320); lost 1,526 customers (35.8%) vs 1,582 new customers.
- Revenue concentration: top 2% ≈ 36% of revenue; top 20% > 73%.
- Anonymous transactions: 24.5% of transactions in Year 2 (revenue share ≈ 15.1%); anonymous AOV £1,032.50 (vs Elite £931.20).
- SKU concentration: top 5% SKUs ≈ 45.5% of revenue.

Business ask: Prioritize targeted retention for high-value cohorts, convert anonymous buyers into identified customers, and improve data quality to enable measurement and personalization.

## 1. Background and Overview
This project analyses two years of transaction-level data from a UK-based online retailer (gifts & home decoration). The goal is to surface business-critical findings and propose targeted, measurable actions to improve retention, increase customer lifetime value, and reduce revenue risk.

Dataset scope: two-year transaction history (item-level: invoice, SKU, qty, unit price, customer identifier, timestamp, country). [See Data Structure Overview below.]

---

## 2. Data Structure Overview
The dataset comprises two years of transactional records from the online retail store (December 1, 2009 – December 19, 2011). Core fields: InvoiceNo, StockCode (SKU), Description, Quantity, InvoiceDate, UnitPrice, CustomerID, Country.

Recommended additions (in pipeline): discount flag, normalized customer contact fields, promo table, canonical product master, cancellation linkage via standardized invoice IDs.

---

## 3. Executive Summary
The dataset originates from an online retail store based in the United Kingdom that specializes in gifts and home decoration products. The analysis covers two years of transaction records, from December 2009 to November 2011, including detailed information on products, transaction dates, quantities, pricing, and customer identifiers. For comparison purposes, the dataset is divided into two periods:
- Year 1: December 1, 2009 – November 30, 2010
- Year 2: December 1, 2010 – November 30, 2011

Business objective: Enable targeted and resource-efficient customer retention and value-growth strategies by delivering reliable customer segmentation (value + behavioral), converting high-AOV anonymous buyers into identified customers, and creating measurement-ready campaigns.

### Key segment metrics (Year‑2 snapshot)
High-level result: Minimal year-over-year growth masks a decline in value among identified customers and the loss of many high-value accounts. Segmentation and data improvements are required to direct retention spend efficiently.

## 4. Insight Deep Dive — WHAT (Key findings) + WHY (Drivers & root causes)


### 4.1 Revenue & customer concentration

Takeaway: Revenue is highly concentrated—small customer cohorts drive most revenue; retention of these cohorts is critical.

- Top 2% ≈ 36% of revenue; top 20% > 73%; bottom 50% ≈ 8%.
- Headcount rose slightly (+1%) but identified-customer revenue fell ~2.7%; retained customers spent ~8% less.
<img width="623" height="463" alt="CustomerPareto" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9d5bc9fd-1d28-4400-9ac3-21c4b976bfaa" />
- Pareto: revenue by customer percentile. Caption: show share of revenue by top X% and mark top-2% and top-20%.

### 4.2 Churn / cohort revenue impact

Takeaway: Net headcount masks an erosion of cohort value — losing high-value customers drove revenue decline.

- Lost 1,526 customers (35.8%) and acquired 1,582 new customers;  many of the churned customers were high-value (76 from prior Year1 top 20%, 5 from top 2%).

<img width="627" height="280" alt="RevenueWaterfall" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0dec4c6e-8e7a-4e5e-86b1-bcf958cb4618" />

- Although new customers generated revenue (~£1,350k), identified-customer revenue declined ~2.7% YoY; retained customers spent ~8% less in Year 2, and Year1 top-20% spent ~13.76% less (~£768k loss).

### 4.3 Anonymous (non-identified) customers

Takeaway: Rising anonymous share is a missed growth & measurement opportunity.

- Anonymous transactions ↑ 24.5% of transactions (Year 2); revenue share ≈ 15.14%.
- Anonymous AOV (£1,032.50) > Elite AOV (£931.20).

### 4.4 Seasonality & buyer heterogeneity

Takeaway: Fall (Nov) spike suggests seasonal playbook; wholesaler behaviors distort simple RFM.

- Fall ≈ 36.9% revenue, November peak; wholesalers show diverse frequency patterns that reduce RFM effectiveness.
- Implication: Use behavior-aware segmentation (wholesale vs retail; seasonal buyers) rather than plain RFM.

### 4.5 Product concentration & SKU risk

Takeaway: Product portfolio is as concentrated as the customer base — SKU risk is significant.

- 4,737 SKUs sold; top 5% SKUs ≈ 45.5% revenue; top 20% ≈ 78%.
- SKU Pareto and list of Top-20 SKUs with revenue share.

### 4.6 Promo & cancellation signals

Takeaway: Promo usage is limited and uneven; cancellations are common but not the primary churn driver.

- Only 55 customers had recorded discounted transactions — low promotional coverage.
- Cancellation rates high across segments (e.g., VIP ~94% have at least one cancellation). Cancellation revenue largely concentrated in customers with stable revenue histories — suggests cancellations are not the main churn cause.

### 4.7 Segment-Specific Behavioral Insight (Hibernating Customers)

Takeaway: Value concentration follows product tier: high-value segments buy Top items, low-engagement segments stay in low-tier categories. This gap signals an opportunity to shift low-tier customers upward through targeted Top-product trials.

- Hibernating customers consistently spend on Bottom-tier products throughout Year 1.
- “Unknown” frequency customers (<5 purchases) concentrate spending in Mid and Bottom tiers.
- Premium, Elite, and VIP customers allocate most of their spend to Top-tier products, showing clear value segmentation.

### 4.8 Cancellations & Returns — Distribution and Impact

Takeaway: Cancellations are widespread across segments but do not appear to be the primary driver of customer loss.

- Cancellations occur widely across segments (up to ~94% of VIPs and 90% of Elites).

<img width="627" height="376" alt="CancellationStackedBarChart" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a722d25-8fbd-49e5-8b04-1e5f40b25816" />

- Most cancellation-related revenue loss (71.18%) comes from customers with stable or growing spend; only ~26% comes from lost/declining customers.
- Conclusion: Cancellations do not appear to be a primary driver of churn.

## 5. Recommendations (short action summary)

Action summary (top priorities):

1. Protect and grow top cohorts — targeted retention campaigns for top‑20% (and VIP/Elite). Use holdout tests and measure incremental LTV.
2. Convert anonymous buyers — low-friction capture (email/receipt, registration incentives) to unlock targeted marketing.
3. Data & pipeline fixes — canonical product & customer masters, discount flag, cancellation linking, ETL dedupe & identifier normalization.
4. Behavior-aware segmentation — separate wholesalers and seasonal buyers; use product propensity for offer targeting.

Full recommendations and campaign playbook are in Recommendation.md (detailed campaign table + sample offers + KPIs).

## 6. Methodology / How to reproduce / Limitations / Metric definitions
- Repro environment: notebooks in /notebooks (Jupyter / Colab) — replace with ["Tools used"].
- Data sources: transactional CSV in /data — replace with actual path or S3 location.
- How to reproduce: run notebooks/00_data_prep.ipynb → 01_segmentation.ipynb → 02_insights.ipynb (or run the provided pipeline). See requirements.txt / environment.yml for package list. [Replace placeholder with actual files/tools].
- Limitations: missing / noisy identifiers, limited promo metadata, inconsistent SKU descriptions & unit prices across rows, partial cancellation linkage.
- Metric definitions: include short definitions (Revenue = sum(UnitPrice × Quantity), AOV = revenue / orders, Retained customer = customer with transactions in both periods, etc.) — expand in a separate section if needed.
